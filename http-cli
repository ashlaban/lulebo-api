Sending a large request body to a server after a request has been rejected for inappropriate headers would be inefficient. To have a server check the request\'s headers, a client must send Expect: 100-continue as a header in its initial request and receive a 100 Continue status code in response before sending the body. If the client receives an error code such as 403 (Forbidden) or 405 (Method Not Allowed) then it shouldn\'t send the request\'s body. The response 417 Expectation Failed indicates that the request should be repeated without the Expect header as it indicates that the server doesn\'t support expectations (this is the case, for example, of HTTP/1.0 servers).',

#
# 103 Checkpoint
#     Used in the resumable requests proposal to resume aborted PUT or POST requests.
# 103 Early Hints

# 420 Method Failure (Spring Framework)
#     A deprecated response used by the Spring Framework when a method has failed.
# 420 Enhance Your Calm (Twitter)
#     Returned by version 1 of the Twitter Search and Trends API when the client is being rate limited; versions 1.1 and later use the 429 Too Many Requests response code instead.

#     The Microsoft extension code indicated when Windows Parental Controls are turned on and are blocking access to the requested webpage.
# 498 Invalid Token (Esri)
#     Returned by ArcGIS for Server. Code 498 indicates an expired or otherwise invalid token.

#     The server has exceeded the bandwidth specified by the server administrator; this is often used by shared hosting providers to limit the bandwidth of customers.
# 530 Site is frozen
#     Used by the Pantheon web platform to indicate a site that has been frozen due to inactivity.
# 598 (Informal convention) Network read timeout error
#     Used by some HTTP proxies to signal a network read timeout behind the proxy to a client in front of the proxy.
